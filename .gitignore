# Go module cache and build cache
# Set by 'go env GOPATH', often '~/go'
# Module download cache
# https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-cache
# For CI/CD environments, it may be beneficial to cache this dir
# rather than download it again for each build
#
# Note: go.mod and go.sum MUST be committed to VCS.
pkg/
# If using build cache
# $GOBIN (defaults to $GOPATH/bin) and $GOCACHE (defaults to $GOPATH/pkg/mod)
# are usually outside the module.
# Check your Go environment: `go env GOCACHE`
